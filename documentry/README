This table represents an integrated system for a smart car operating on Raspberry Pi.
The system contains 22 essential components that work together harmoniously to achieve autonomous driving and artificial intelligence.
At the heart of the system is the Raspberry Pi 4, serving as the main control unit, acting as the "brain" that processes all data and makes critical decisions, supported by a high-speed memory card to store the operating system and complex programs.
Connected to this brain is a high-resolution camera acting as the car's "eye," continuously capturing images of the surrounding environment and analyzing them to determine the path, obstacles, and colored signals.
The motion system consists of three specialized motors: a powerful servo motor for steering that precisely controls the front wheels, and two separate electric motors for the rear wheels, providing the necessary power for forward and backward movement. 
These motors are controlled by the L298N motor driver, which regulates their speed and direction based on signals from the main control unit. 
To ensure safety and avoid collisions, the system includes a network of three strategically placed ultrasonic sensors: one at the front to detect direct obstacles, and two on the sides to measure the distance from walls and barriers.
