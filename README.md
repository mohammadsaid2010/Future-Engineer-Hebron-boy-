This robot is designed to operate fully autonomously, utilizing an advanced set of sensors and modern technologies. It features the ability to:- *Avoid obstacles* with high precision using *Ultrasonic* sensors that enable it to measure distances and interact with the surrounding environment in real-time.- *Recognize colors* through a *Raspberry Pi* camera, allowing it to identify visual signals or specific areas based on color.- *Orbit in a circular path* either *clockwise or counterclockwise*, using a *Gyroscope* sensor to adjust directions and maintain balance while moving.- *Drive autonomously* along designated paths using an intelligent navigation system that combines image processing and dynamic control.This robot represents an ideal blend of artificial intelligence and mechanical engineering, serving as an advanced model in the field of educational and practical robotics.
